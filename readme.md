# Personal Projects

This repository will be for an ongoing personal fullstack app to house different projects I want to work on in my own time.

The plan is to make a React front-end SAP with login functionality and an ongoing menu of projects to explore. Some of them will likely be simple games for the sake of coding practice. Others may be simple apps I've thought up and wanted to create.

The plan is also to implement a backend with MongoDB to save "state" in games and apps, to practice with backend development.
